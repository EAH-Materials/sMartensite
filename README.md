# sMartensite
sMartensite is a Deep-Learning Project to classify FSD-SEM images into the phases: Austenite, thermal Martensite, machanically induced Martensite and surface martensite.

To clone the project use the command:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules -j2 https://github.com/EAH-Materials/sMartensite.git
```

The submodule mtex-toolbox is included for preprocessing of EBSD-Data, which is used to generate ground truth labels for training a CNN.
