# sMartensite
sMartensite is a Deep-Learning Project to classify FSD-SEM images into the phases: Austenite, thermal Martensite, machanically induced Martensite and surface martensite.

To clone the project use the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/EAH-Materials/sMartensite.git
```

The mtex-toolbox must be included for preprocessing of EBSD-Data, which is used to generate ground truth labels for training a CNN. Download the compiled version here:
